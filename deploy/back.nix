# ginsim.nix
#
# Packages GINsim.
#
# You can build this file with the following command:
#
#   nix-build ginsim.nix
#
# This will create the symlink result in the current directory.  The
# runnable shell script is result/bin/GINsim.
#
# You can use this file in a nix-shell, as shell.nix illustrates.

  # -jar â€¦ to the Java executable, thus pointing it to the actual
